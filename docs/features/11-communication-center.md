Develop a centralized **Communication Center** that enables agencies to manage all customer communications from a single platform. The module should support email and SMS messaging for both individual customers and bulk campaigns while integrating seamlessly with projects, billing, support, and customer management.

The Communication Center should serve as the agency's primary communication hub, allowing users to send personalized, automated, and AI-assisted messages throughout the customer lifecycle.
